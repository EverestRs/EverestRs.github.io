16:T4c7,This course primarily discusses the fundamental composition principles and operational mechanisms of standalone computer hardware systems. The course is centered around two main themes: "Basic Structure of Computers" and "Working Principles of Computers," focusing on addressing two fundamental questions in computer science: "What is a program? (the essence of a program)" and "How is a program executed? (the external aspect of a program)." Starting from the five major components that constitute the hardware system, the course explains the working principles, design methods, and basic principles of integrating these components into a complete system. The main topics include: computer systems; digital systems; arithmetic and arithmetic units; storage systems; instruction sets; and the central processing unit. Through the teaching and practice of this course, students are expected to develop a comprehensive understanding of the entire computer system, laying a solid foundation for further in-depth study of subsequent computer-related courses, and equipping graduates with the foundational professional knowledge and basic information processing abilities necessary to apply computers to solve relevant problems.17:T415,This is a hands-on course focused on practical training and serves as a foundational course for the Internet of Things engineering major. It emphasizes protocol design skills and basic communication capabilities. Through this course, students will be able to conduct requirement analysis for IoT scenarios and design communication protocols and storage structures based on C language concepts such as structs and linked lists. By integrating the study and use of Socket network communication interfaces under the Windows operating system, students will complete the development of IoT communication server and client programs. The course centers on encapsulating communication protocols with structs and introduces network communication mechanisms directly based on structs, including serialization and deserialization of structs, IP addresses and ports, UDP protocol, TCP protocol, and other related knowledge points. Studying this course lays a solid foundation for students to build more complex IoT communication architectures in the future.18:T4b2,This course covers four wireless network technologies: ZigBee, LoRa, BLE (Bluetooth Low Energy), and Wi-Fi. The main content includes the fundamentals of computer networks, classification and applications of wireless networks, characteristics of the ZigBee standard, ZigBee networking, physical layer features of LoRa, application of the LoRaWAN protocol stack, characteristics and applications of Bluetooth, BLE technology, development and application of the BLE protocol stack, development of Wi-Fi standards, system composition of Wi-Fi, Wi-Fi protocols, Wi-Fi network security mechanisms, and Wi-Fi applications. The course trains students in the basic skills of perception layer networking and enables them to proficiently use protocol stacks to develop low-power data acquisition nodes, ultimately completing data upload and download through networking. This course is a crucial core professional course for the Internet of Things Engineering major, playing an important role in cultivating students' abilities in IoT design, development, and deployment, enhancing embedded system programming skills, and providing theoretical guidance and practical groundwork for subsequent specialized courses.7:["$","div",null,{"className":"max-w-4xl mx-auto px-4 sm:px-6 lg:px-8 py-12","children":[false,false,["$","$L15",null,{"config":{"type":"card","title":"Teaching","description":"Courses I have taught.","items":[{"title":"Principles and Applications of Edge Computing","subtitle":"Main Presenter","date":["2024","2025"],"content":"This is an elective course for the Internet of Things (IoT) major, primarily introducing the theoretical methods, key technologies, system platforms, and cutting-edge applications of edge computing.
